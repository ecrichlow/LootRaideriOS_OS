# Loot Raider iOS

v1.7 (c) 2018 Infusions of Grandeur - Written By: Eric Crichlow

## Background

Loot Raider is the "spiritual successor" to a game named "Gold Runner", which was released for the TRS-80 Color Computer back in the mid 80s. That is also the game I released and open-sourced an iOS version of a number of years ago.

As Gold Runner was a clone of another game sold for more popular computers, there were copyright issues that drew the attention and ire of the original game's copyright holder.

In order to make a game that was true to the spirit of the original, but was different enough in its gameplay that it wasn't subject to legal entanglements, I changed the fundamental play mechanics and added new features that make this its own unique game.

## History

Version 1.7 :	Initial public release

## Assets

The sprites used by the game, as well as the gameboard files for the first 6 levels, are contained in the project. These assets were created using a customer editor that I wrote on the Mac.

## Usage

Details about the file formats of the sprites and gameboards can be found in the file "WhatWasIThinking". This file also contains information about some of the thought processes that went into the architecture and development of the game.

The file with the values used for Firebase Analytics has been removed. So the project will compile but not run without replacing that file.

Edit: To make building and running the app easier, I re-added the Firebase file, GoogleService-Info.plist, with bogus values inserted.
